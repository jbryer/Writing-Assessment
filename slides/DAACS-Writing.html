# Automated Scoring of Student Essays for Diagnostic Assessments
## Statistics &amp; Probability for Data Analytics

# Introduction

* In the last few years there have been significant advances in the analysis of text data, specifically the introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs, e.g. OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.).

* The development of LLMs has been largely driven by *transformer* models ([Vaswani et all, 2017](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2017/file/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Paper.pdf)).

* The Diagnostic Assessment and Achievement of College Skills has been using [LightSide](https://ankara.lti.cs.cmu.edu/side/) (Mayfield, Adamson &amp; Rosé, 2015) to score essays. 

### Research Question

Do the more modern tokenizers perform better than the traditional rule-based tokenizers?

# What is DAACS?

* A suite of technological and social support to optimize student learning.

* No-stakes, diagnostic (formative?) assessments in:
	* Self-Regulated Learning
	* Writing
	* Reading Comprehension
	* Mathematics

* Provides students with immediate feedback about strengths and weaknesses along with links to open educational resources (OER).

* Coaches, Academic Advisors, and Instructors can utilize student results to provide more targeted supports.

* Data is used in predictive analytic efforts to increase the accuracy of identifying "at-risk" students.

|content      |summary     |The essay uses relevant survey results and feedback to provide a detailed summary of the student's strengths and weaknesses in terms of self-regulated learning. |The essay refers to survey results and feedback in the summary of strengths and weaknesses related to self-regulated learning. The summary is a bit thin though: Additional, relevant details and examples would have strengthened it.                              |The summary of strengths and weaknesses in SRL is under-developed. It might need more detail about the results and feedback, and/or should address both strengths and weaknesses, rather than one or the other.                                                             |
|content      |suggestions |The discussion of suggestions for improvement in SRL are logically and explicitly related to the survey results and feedback, and developed in sufficient depth. |The essay includes a clear discussion of improvements to be made to SRL, but the connections to the survey results and feedback are not always explicit and clear.                                                                                                  |The discussion of possible improvements in SRL is vague and/or disconnected from the strengths and weaknesses discussed in the summary. It might have been stronger if the suggestions for improvement were more specific, and explicitly tied to the results and feedback. |
|organization |structure   |The essay is well-organized, with an order and structure that present the discussion in a clear, logical manner.                                                 |The essay has a basic structure but does not offer a clear, overall organization that enables a reader to understand the progression of one idea to another. It might have been strengthened by the inclusion of an introduction, topic sentences, conclusion, etc. |The essay is not carefully structured. It might move almost randomly from one point to the next. It could have been strengthened by the use of an introduction, topic sentences, a conclusion, and other organizational features.                                           |

|organization |transitions |Transitions between paragraphs are appropriate and effective, and strengthen the progression of the essay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |Transitions between paragraphs include language that signals a shift from one main idea to the next, as needed (e.g. "In terms of monitoring what I do..." "In the mindset category . . ."). The use of additional transitions (e.g. similarly, in addition, next, as a result) would have helped link the paragraphs and strengthen the overall organization of the essay.                                           |Transitions between paragraphs are missing or ineffective. As a result, the paragraphs abruptly shift from one idea to the next.

|paragraphs   |ideas       |Paragraphs are consistently and clearly focused on a main idea or point.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |In general, each paragraph has a clear focus. Some might have been strengthened by a topic sentence that establishes the focus, but the main ideas are apparent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |Most or all paragraphs lack a clear focus on a main point or topic, perhaps because too many ideas are packed into one paragraph.  Each topic should be fully developed in separate paragraphs. Each paragraph should include a statement of the main point, and every sentence in the paragraph should relate to that point.                                                             |
|paragraphs   |cohesion    |Within paragraphs, the individual sentences are seamlessly linked together; the reader can see the relationship between the ideas or information in one sentence and those in another sentence. The writing explicitly links sentences and ideas using adverbs (e.g., similarly, also, therefore), relative pronouns (e.g., who, that, which), conjunctions (e.g., and, or, while, whereas), and/or the repetition of key words, as appropriate. |The ideas or information in each sentence within a paragraph are loosely linked together. The connections between sentences would have been clarified by additional or better choices of linking words and phrases, such as adverbs (e.g., similarly, also, therefore), relative pronouns (e.g., who, that, which), conjunctions (e.g., and, or, while, whereas), and/or the repetition of key words, as appropriate. |Because the ideas or information in each sentence within a paragraph are not linked together, it is hard for a reader to see the relationship between  sentences.

# Data Source

.pull-left[

1,065 essays were collected from Western Governors University and the University at Albany, 592 of which were double scored. For WGU, the first 893 essays that were collected as part of a larger randomized control trial were included. The remaining essays were randomly selected from the University at Albany.

There were two scoring events with a total of 15 raters supervised by two subject matter experts.

# Workflow for automated machine scoring

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

For this study predictive models were trained on 75% of the observations. Prediction accuracies are calculated from the test data.

For essays that were double scored, the conferral score was used. Otherwise the single rater score was used.

# Tokenization

Tokenization is the process of coverting text into vectors or matrices.

&lt;img src="figures/tokenization.png" width="691" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

[Vaswani et al](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2017/file/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Paper.pdf) (2017) introduced the *transformer* model approach to tokenization. Unlike traditional rule based tokenization, transformer models are trained on a large corpus of text in order to not only find the basic word structures, but to also to infer context by finding nearby reoccurring tokens.

# Discussion

* In general, the new generation of tokenizers are an improvement over the rule based tokenizers.

* The more modern tokenizers (e.g. BERT, SciKit Vectors, word2vec, etc.) all perform equally well. 

* The choice of predictive model seems to have a bigger impact on model accuracy. This is consistent with prior research (see e.g. [Fernández-Delgado, Cernados, Barro, &amp; Amorin, 2014](https://jmlr.org/papers/volume15/delgado14a/delgado14a.pdf)).

* These new models will soon be integrated into the DAACS system.
